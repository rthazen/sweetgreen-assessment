# Assignment Overview

Create a simple e-commerce web application that demonstrates your front-end capabilities, with a strong emphasis on mobile compatibility and user experience. This project will assess your ability to design, implement, test, and communicate about your solution effectively.

# Application Requirements

Your application should allow users to perform the following actions:

## View a List of Items: Display items available for purchase.

## Add Items to Shopping Cart: Enable users to add items they wish to buy.

## Checkout Process: Allow users to submit an order (payment integration is not required).

## Purchase Confirmation: Show a confirmation message with the total amount and a transaction ID.

# Front-End Focus

## Mobile Compatibility: Ensure that the web application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on mobile devices of varying screen sizes. It must be responsive and user-friendly across different screen sizes but does not need to be compiled into a native application.

## User Experience: Prioritize an intuitive and smooth user experience. Pay attention to navigation, accessibility, and user feedback mechanisms.

## State Management: Implement state management to handle cart operations efficiently. Use a state management library or framework (e.g., Redux, MobX, Context API, XState, etc.).

# Technology Stack

We recommend that you complete this assignment using React, but if you feel another framework would be better suited just let us know that you plan to leverage something else.

# Testing

Please include tests for your code to demonstrate your testing practices. You should cover key functionality, such as:

## Displaying items

## Adding items to the cart

## Completing the checkout process

# Deliverables

Once you complete your application, please submit the following:

## Source Code: Push your project to a GitHub repository.

## Documentation: Include a document (README.md, Google Doc, etc.) that briefly covers the following:

### Overview of Your Application: Describe what the application does and its main features.

### How It Works: Explain the architecture and what happens behind the scenes (e.g., data flow, state management, interactions between components).

### Approach to Problem-Solving: Discuss your thought process when tackling this project and any challenges you faced.

### Mobile Compatibility Strategy: Explain how you ensured the application is mobile-friendly, including any specific tools or techniques used.

### State Management Strategy: Describe your approach to managing the state of the application, particularly with respect to cart operations.

### Future Extensions: Suggest how you would enhance the application for a more robust e-commerce experience (e.g., user authentication, payment processing, inventory management).

### Testing Strategy: Describe how you approached testing your application, including the types of tests you wrote and why.

# Follow-Up

During a future interview, you may be asked to present your project and discuss potential additional features.

# Questions

If you have any questions or need clarification about the assignment, please feel free to reach out.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
